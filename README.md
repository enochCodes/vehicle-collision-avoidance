# vehicle-collision-avoidance
This project was created for the 24 hour Bosch hackathon challenge focused on vehicle collision avoidance systems. It implements object detection and tracking from a provided dataset, identifies driving scenarios, and simulates collision avoidance strategies.
# Main Features:
. Loads and processes object data from a .csv dataset
. Visualizes vehicle environment and object motions over time
. Identifies driving scenarios like CPNCO, CPTA, CPLA
. Calculates braking distances and deceleration parameters
. Simulates collision avoidance outcomes for identified scenarios
# Programing language Used:
. Python 
. Opencv2 , numpy
. Carla (virtual enviroment)
. Tensorflow (optional for ML models)
# Gitting Started:
. clone the repo
. Install dependencies
. copy The file's Into carla exmple folder 
. 
# Next Steps:
. Improve object trajectory forecasting
. Expand to more scenarios and sensors
. Implement on a real vehicle
